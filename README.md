# Mexican Train Dominos Script

A simple script I wrote after playing Mexican Train Dominos with family. Can be used to find the optimal opening train for a given set of dominos and the chosen double.

Example usage:
```bash
$ python3 dominos.py
Enter your dominos (eg. 1 4, 12 6): 
    6 0, 5 0, 1 3, 3 0, 1 6, 1 5, 2 3, 1 0, 4 0, 4 4, 10 0, 9 1
Enter your double (eg. 8):
    6
Best sequence: [6|1] [1|3] [3|0] [0|5] [5|1] [1|0] [0|10] 
With a score of: 36

```
